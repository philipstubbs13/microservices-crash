# Intro to Microservices

* Molecular Framework: <https://moleculer.services/>

* Monolithic Architecture

  - Built and deployed as a single unit.
  - Easy to develop, test and deploy.

  * Cheaper and simpler infrastructure.
  * Usually built with single tech stack.
  * Can run into issues when scaling.

* Microservices Architecture

  - Collection of small, loosely coupled services.
  - Self-contained, can be developed, deployed and scaled independently.

  * Communicate with each other with protocols like HTTP.
  * Not tied to any specific technology, language, framewor, etc.
  * Adds more complexity to an application.
  * Larger infrastructure and more expensive than monolith.

* Service Oriented Architeture (SOA)

  - Differences From Microservices:
    - Communication
    - Middlewaare Complexity
    - Granularity
    - Data Management

* Pros

  - Scalability
  - Flexibility
  - Resilience
  - Modular & Decentralized
  - Team Autonomy

* Cons
  - Complexity
  - Operational Overhead
  - Data Management
  - Development Time
  - Debugging
